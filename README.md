## Analyze the Boston house Price Data & Give Prediction


> Welcome to Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s! Imagine you're working for a real estate development company. Your company wants to value any residential project before they start. You are tasked with building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:

- The number of rooms

- The distance to employment centres

- How rich or poor the area is

- How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc



## What I've learned:

✅ Analysed and explored the Boston house price data

✅ Splited data for training and testing

✅ Ran a Multivariable Regression

✅ Evaluated model's coefficients and residuals

✅ Used data transformation to improve your model performance

✅ Used your model to estimate a property price
